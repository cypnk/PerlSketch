# PerlSketch
A simple script for testing and learning Perl

This is a staring point for a small web page with blog posts and similar content, created to learn Perl and play with content creating and editing.

The script is intended to serve multiple websites. The demo site is located in ```storage/sites/perl.local```. Create a virtual host with this domain in your web server configuration and add ```perl.local``` to your hosts file to test locally.
